Beneath the crescent moon and golden light, 
in verdant fields blooming with wildflowers,
a soft breeze whispers truths left unsaid.
as the symphony of nature starts to play.

Birds that sing, their songs delightful,
Their elegant feat of flying on their wings.
They paint stories of love that never fade
as they dance over the canvas of the sky.

Dreams are reflected in the river's 
silvery stream like a glimmer in a mirror.
Its calm currents and calming 
melody show us where we belong.

Oh, the way the trees sway in the wind
with their entwined, reaching branches.
With roots extending far into the earth,
A timeless grace, an ageless wisdom.

As the gentle embrace of evening draws in,
 the stars appear, each choosing their own position.
As they guide strays through the night,
they twinkle brightly, creating a beautiful scene.
